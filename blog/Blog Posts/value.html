title: What are you worth?

When someone asks you who you are, the answer could be anything. A career - engineer, scientist, artist, writer, NEET, etc. Or some defining features - my laziness, my anger issues, my addictions. Or maybe it's something else entirely - my hairdo, or my signature water bottle, or the weird way I walk.

Topic change - bet you didn't see that coming. As we all know, Christ died for our sins. And that He came and died specifically for your sins. Not just a generic "He died for everybody's sins and stuff," but He died specifically for your sins. For many others as well, but for you specifically.

A thought came into my mind while thinking about this the other day. Does this not mean that the Lord thought of you as he carried His cross up Cavalry? As He was crucified and as he hung on the cross? In that moment, He thought of you and said "This is who I am doing this for. This is who I am suffering and dying for. I came into the world for this purpose." I know, that might be a lot of people to think about, but it's God doing the thinking here. I'm sure He could do it.

No offense, but what makes you worth it? Really, don't take that offensively because as Jesus can tell you, you were worth it. You are worth it. This is sounding like some emotional pep talk - say that in front of the mirror 3 times every morning. Just kidding, let's get back on topic. The reality is that He did die for you.

In my case, this was really hard to conceive of. Did Jesus die for me, who struggles with getting out of bed, going to a job I don't like? Who somehow always ends up sinning (am I not trying hard enough?)? Who writes some stupid posts that nobody reads?

No. He died for a different side of me. And I bet you that if you try to look at yourself from God's point of view, you'll see a different you than that hipster scientist with anger management issues. And I'll wager that that's a better you. A more relevant you. The only you that matters.

So maybe take some time to imagine that this Good Friday as you meditate on His 7 last words. Let's try to see ourselves the way God sees us. Maybe then we can get some perspective on how to live our lives and how to better glorify God.
