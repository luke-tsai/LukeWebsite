title: 30 Pieces of Silver

As everyone and their mom knows, there were 12 disciples. Over the last few days, as part of my reflection on the Passion, I've been thinking about 2 of them in particular.

<p class="bottom">
In Christian culture, Judas Iscariot is often vilified - don't get me wrong, this isn't a defense of Judas! I think many people would say he deserves it. After all, he betrayed our Lord. But what if we switch it up and put ourselves in Judas' shoes. How much does it take for you to betray our Lord?</p><p class="bottom">Let me place a few claims here next to each other. This may make where I'm going with this obvious.</p><p class="bottom">1. Judas is terrible because he betrayed our Lord. He crucified our Lord for 30 pieces of silver.</p><p class="bottom">2. Every time we commit mortal sin, we crucify the Lord again. (See note at bottom.)</p><p class="bottom">Say a friend comes to you and says, "Hey, I got free tickets to whatever concert this weekend." The caveat is that you have to miss Sunday Mass to go. Do you go? What if there was a free car but you had to go pick it up? How much is your 30 pieces of silver?</p><p class="bottom">In fact, if we take it away from the direct monetary sense, it gets even more sad. Many young folks are in a persistent state of mortal sin due to sexual immorality. Is the few minutes of pleasure your 30 pieces of silver?</p><p class="bottom">The tough reality is that we betray the Lord all the time. What makes us different?</p><p class="bottom">This led me to my reflection on another disciple, and perhaps this is a more happy reflection. Peter. The specific moment I want to bring your attention to is Luke 22. The specific sections being Peter's denial of Jesus. I'll copy the relevant parts here:</p><blockquote><p>"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren." And he said to him, "Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death." He said, "I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow this day, until you three times deny that you know me." (Luke 22:31-34)</p></blockquote><p class="bottom">Later on, it continues:</p><blockquote><p>Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest’s house. Peter followed at a distance; and when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them. Then a maid, seeing him as he sat in the light and gazing at him, said, "This man also was with him." But he denied it, saying, "Woman, I do not know him.” And a little later some one else saw him and said, “You also are one of them." But Peter said, "Man, I am not.” And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, "Certainly this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean." But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are saying." And immediately, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed. And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, "Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly. (Luke 22:54-62)</p></blockquote><p class="bottom">I think I am the same way. When I'm at adoration in a moment of prayer, my resolve is amazing. My act of contrition ends with "...I firmly resolve with the help of thy grace to confess my sins, to do penance, and to sin no more." To sin no more. And I mean that 100%. Yet how many times have I ended up back in the confessional?</p><p class="bottom">I also find Jesus' prayer very interesting. I'll quote it again. "I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren." What a line. I think this may be the prayer that keeps Peter from ending with a Judas-like ending.</p><p class="bottom">The moment after he commits the sin of apostasy the third time, the Lord makes eye contact with Peter. And at that moment, he remembered the Lord's words to him. He remembers how the Lord looked at him that moment earlier in the evening, when Jesus already knew of his upcoming betrayal. And he remembered his role - to turn again and to strengthen his brethren.</p><p class="bottom">Is this not our role as well? To turn again and strengthen our brethren? And this is what the difference is. Not specifically the act itself, but the way we respond afterwards. Both Judas and Peter regret their actions. Both feel sorrow. But one quits, while the other turns around and strengthens his brethren. Let us do the same.</p><p class="bottom">Note, in case you had a beef with point 2, above. Catechism of the Catholic Church, Paragraph 598 says (emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p class="bottom">In her Magisterial teaching of the faith and in the witness of her saints, the Church has never forgotten that "sinners were the authors and the ministers of all the sufferings that the divine Redeemer endured." Taking into account the fact that our sins affect Christ himself, the Church does not hesitate to impute to Christians the gravest responsibility for the torments inflicted upon Jesus, a responsibility with which they have all too often burdened the Jews alone:</p><p class="bottom">We must regard as guilty all those who continue to relapse into their sins. Since our sins made the Lord Christ suffer the torment of the cross, <b>those who plunge themselves into disorders and crimes crucify the Son of God anew in their hearts</b> (for he is in them) and hold him up to contempt. And it can be seen that our crime in this case is greater in us than in the Jews. As for them, according to the witness of the Apostle, "None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory." We, however, profess to know him. And when we deny him by our deeds, we in some way seem to lay violent hands on him.</p><p>Nor did demons crucify him; <b>it is you who have crucified him and crucify him still, when you delight in your vices and sins.</b></p></blockquote>
