							<h3>30 Pieces of Silver</h3>
							As everyone and their mom knows, there were 12 disciples. Over the last few days, as part of my reflection on the Passion, I've been thinking about 2 of them in particular. </p> <p class="bottom"> In Christian culture, Judas Iscariot is often vilified - don't get me wrong, this isn't a defense of Judas! I think many people would say he deserves it. After all, he betrayed our Lord. But what if we switch it up and put ourselves in Judas' shoes. How much does it take for you to betray our Lord?</p><p class="bottom">Let me place a few claims here next to each other. This may make where I'm going with this obvious.</p><p class="bottom">1. Judas is terrible because he betrayed our Lord. He crucified our Lord for 30 pieces of silver.</p><p class="bottom">2. Every time we commit mortal sin, we crucify the Lord again. (See note at bottom.)</p><p class="bottom">Say a friend comes to you and says, "Hey, I got free tickets to whatever concert this weekend." The caveat is that you have to miss Sunday Mass to go. Do you go? What if there was a free car but you had to go pick it up? How much is your 30 pieces of silver?</p><p class="bottom">In fact, if we take it away from the direct monetary sense, it gets even more sad. Many young folks are in a persistent state of mortal sin due to sexual immorality. Is the few minutes of pleasure your 30 pieces of silver?</p><p class="bottom">The tough reality is that we betray the Lord all the time. What makes us different?</p><p class="bottom">This led me to my reflection on another disciple, and perhaps this is a more happy reflection. Peter. The specific moment I want to bring your attention to is Luke 22. The specific sections being Peter's denial of Jesus. I'll copy the relevant parts here:</p><blockquote><p>"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren." And he said to him, "Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death." He said, "I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow this day, until you three times deny that you know me." (Luke 22:31-34)</p></blockquote><p class="bottom">Later on, it continues:</p><blockquote><p>Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest’s house. Peter followed at a distance; and when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them. Then a maid, seeing him as he sat in the light and gazing at him, said, "This man also was with him." But he denied it, saying, "Woman, I do not know him.” And a little later some one else saw him and said, “You also are one of them." But Peter said, "Man, I am not.” And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, "Certainly this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean." But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are saying." And immediately, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed. And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, "Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly. (Luke 22:54-62)</p></blockquote><p class="bottom">I think I am the same way. When I'm at adoration in a moment of prayer, my resolve is amazing. My act of contrition ends with "...I firmly resolve with the help of thy grace to confess my sins, to do penance, and to sin no more." To sin no more. And I mean that 100%. Yet how many times have I ended up back in the confessional?</p><p class="bottom">I also find Jesus' prayer very interesting. I'll quote it again. "I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren." What a line. I think this may be the prayer that keeps Peter from ending with a Judas-like ending.</p><p class="bottom">The moment after he commits the sin of apostasy the third time, the Lord makes eye contact with Peter. And at that moment, he remembered the Lord's words to him. He remembers how the Lord looked at him that moment earlier in the evening, when Jesus already knew of his upcoming betrayal. And he remembered his role - to turn again and to strengthen his brethren.</p><p class="bottom">Is this not our role as well? To turn again and strengthen our brethren? And this is what the difference is. Not specifically the act itself, but the way we respond afterwards. Both Judas and Peter regret their actions. Both feel sorrow. But one quits, while the other turns around and strengthens his brethren. Let us do the same.</p><p class="bottom">Note, in case you had a beef with point 2, above. Catechism of the Catholic Church, Paragraph 598 says (emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p class="bottom">In her Magisterial teaching of the faith and in the witness of her saints, the Church has never forgotten that "sinners were the authors and the ministers of all the sufferings that the divine Redeemer endured." Taking into account the fact that our sins affect Christ himself, the Church does not hesitate to impute to Christians the gravest responsibility for the torments inflicted upon Jesus, a responsibility with which they have all too often burdened the Jews alone:</p><p class="bottom">We must regard as guilty all those who continue to relapse into their sins. Since our sins made the Lord Christ suffer the torment of the cross, <b>those who plunge themselves into disorders and crimes crucify the Son of God anew in their hearts</b> (for he is in them) and hold him up to contempt. And it can be seen that our crime in this case is greater in us than in the Jews. As for them, according to the witness of the Apostle, "None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory." We, however, profess to know him. And when we deny him by our deeds, we in some way seem to lay violent hands on him.</p><p>Nor did demons crucify him; <b>it is you who have crucified him and crucify him still, when you delight in your vices and sins.</b></p></blockquote>

							<h3>Free Will and Time</h3>
							I've been trying to cohesively meld my theological and philisophical together - if I'm a consistent and logical person, this should not be difficult. We'll see how it goes. This is part one. </p> <h4>Time</h4> <p class="bottom"> There are a few popular theories of time, popularly stemming from John McTaggart's initial characterization. I've put together an overly simplified time theory explanation below. </p> <ul> 	<li>A-theory - Presentism: I figure this is what most people intuitively think. Now exists. The past and the future do not exist, only the present.</li> 	<li>A-theory - Growing Block Universe: Past and present exist, but the future doesn't.</li> 	<li>B-theory - Eternalism: Flow of time is an illusion. All moments in time exist equally.</li> 	<li>A-theory - Four-dimensionalism: Time is the fourth dimension.</li> </ul> <p class="bottom"> This might seem like all irrelevant thinking, and maybe it is. But consider the impacts of following one of these theories. </p> <p class="bottom">With the A theories, time travel has theoretical limitations. How could someone visit a time that doesn't exist? With presentism, both past and future are inaccessible. With a growing block universe, we'd be able to time travel to the past, but not the the future. (Unless we're somehow not at the front edge of the growing block? Woah... Let's not think about that yet...) </p> <p class="bottom">With the B theories, time travel could work. I find this set of theories much more intriguing. </p> <h4>Free Will</h4> <p class="bottom"> Here, there are 2 theological views that I find relevant for this section. There are other theories, but I don't find them compelling enough to be worth discussing as I find it necessary to maintain that there is a solution to the paradox of free will. That is, how can the concept of the elect not contradict the concept of free will? I'll summarize them below. </p> <h5>Efficacious grace</h5> <p class="bottom"> As St. Augustine puts it, God chooses certain people for salvation, and grants them the gift of efficacious grace, such that it's impossible for them to fall away from their faith. Each person has the liberty to act as they wish, and inevitably falls short, unless God intercedes with efficacious grace. In short, some people are predestined for heaven. </p> <p class="bottom"> Calvinists take this a step further, saying that those who are not predestined for heaven are predestined for hell. Dominicans would reject this claim, nuancing that those who go to hell do so by their own choices, not because of predestination. </p> <h5>Molinism</h5> <p class="bottom"> Molinism takes an opposite approach, positing this thing called middle knowledge. For context, natural knowlege is known by God by His nature, before creation. This includes all necessary truths, such as tautoligies and mathmatical certainties. For example, all bachelors are unmarried. Or 1+1=2. On the other hand, free knowledge is that which is post-creation. This includes all contingent truths. For example, the sky is blue. Middle knowledge sits between these - the knowledge is pre-creation, but still contingent. This basically is a complex if statement. For example, if John was offered ice cream, he would say yes. This statement does not depend on creation since as an if statement, it would be true whether or not John existed. However, it's truth does still depend on John wanting ice cream. If John existed and did not like ice cream we'd be in trouble. </p> <p class="bottom"> Now given that God has middle knowledge and knows what we would do in each situation, God could set up the final ending while still preserving free will. Preventing John from eating ice cream would no longer be a matter of providing enough grace to resist it, but of a flat tire on the ice cream truck that morning. As a result, God can choose who receives salvation, but every choice along the way was done with free will. </p> <h5>Arminianism</h5> <p class="bottom"> This is a common third theory that needs to be mentioned. Arminians believe that grace is resistable, and so election is conditional. In my view, a conditional election is equivalent to rejecting election, and so I find it impossible to square. </p> <h4>Melding Theories</h4> <p class="bottom"> While efficacious grace could certainly work with any of these, the pairing I find most interesting and compelling is that of a B-theory universe combined with Molinism. </p> <p class="bottom"> The way I see these working together particularly well is something of a potential multiverse, if you will. If our universe is a B-theory universe, then there concievably could be a large set of possible parallel universes. God would then actualize the universe with His desired result. </p>

							<h3>Plato</h3>
								I've started reading some Plato recently, after an acquaintance introduced me to	<a href="https://www.dialogues-de-platon.org/tetralog.htm" target="_blank">this set of tetralogies put together by Bernard Suzanne.</a> He's organized these tetralogies in a way that is supposed to build on itself and go through Plato's dialogues the way he imagines that Plato would have wanted. It's kind of like how they say that there's a certain order you should watch all the Star Wars movies, which isn't the normal order. This is a similar thing, but with Plato instead of space operas. Anyways, Suzanne structures Plato's dialogues into 7 sets of 4 dialogues with a repeating theme that builds up. </p> <p class="bottom">Ever since I've started the process of reading the dialogues, I've been thinking that Plato's works are a fantastic introduction to starting to think deeply. I think most people would benefit from reading him. It's a shame, I think, that such a staple of classical education was never required at any point growing up. I'm a big fan of the structure he uses - just a conversation between a few characters. Often times, I think philosophy tends to be a set of complex arguments that are very easy to lose track of. The dialogues do a great job of getting people to ask questions they've never asked before.</p><p class="bottom">However, despite being well-suited for beginners and easily accessible for anyone to read, I still think it might be too inaccessible. They are often too verbose, an unavoidable effect of translating conversations that are thousands of years old. Perhaps there's a need for a "translation" of Plato that uses simple language and throws out all the complex parts. I know, I know - Plato fans would be incensed at the suggestion, but I think there's some good in it. I think getting more people to question the world and think deeply can only be a good thing.</p>

							<h3>Crowning of Thorns</h3>
							Throughout Lent, I’ve been praying the rosary much more frequently. As a result of this more frequent prayer, I’ve lessened my focus on the sets of mysteries, and started to look at the mysteries for themselves. For example, instead of praying all five Sorrowful Mysteries in a rigid set, sometimes I'll pray the Crowning With Thorns five times in a row. Breaking this mold has helped me to look at each mystery from a perspective I hadn’t considered before. That being said, here are my thoughts on the Crowning with Thorns. </p> <h4>Literature</h4> <blockquote> 	<p>“Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the praetorium, and they gathered the whole battalion before him. And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe upon him, and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him they mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” And they spat upon him, and took the reed and struck him on the head. And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.” (Matthew 27:27-31, RSV CE)</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> 	<p>“And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the praetorium); and they called together the whole battalion. And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on him. And they began to salute him, “Hail, King of the Jews!” And they struck his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and they knelt down in homage to him. And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak, and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him.” (Mark 15:16-20, RSV CE)</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> 	<p>“And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple robe; they came up to him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and struck him with their hands.” (John 19:2-3, RSV CE)</p> </blockquote> <h4>Thoughts</h4> <p class="bottom">Bold opinion incoming. The Crowning of Thorns is one of the most underappreciated mysteries of the rosary. Of the passion in general, really. Feel free to disagree - I understand why you would.</p> <p class="bottom">From an initial gut reaction, the Scourging at the Pillar is without a doubt a more gruesome and sorrowful scene. The pain inflicted by a whip is something anyone can easily imagine, whereas the Crowning of Thorns was a more abstract event. That’s not to say that it wasn’t painful - I imagine a thorn being pushed into the head to be quite painful, but it's no whip!</p> <p class="bottom">I'd say that this thought process is a common one. For example, in the film The Passion of the Christ, director Mel Gibson spends 13 minutes showing each lash with explicit detail. We see the blood spraying across the square. We see the blood flying onto the face of the soldier. We see Mary’s face in this time of suffering, and we see her mopping up the bloody ground. It's a difficult scene to watch, full of raw emotion that hits us straight in the gut. On the other hand, the Crowning of Thorns scene takes only 40 seconds, and is easily missed. It's over before you really notice that it happened.</p> <p class="bottom">So, allow me to present an my take on the Crowning. If you have a dispute you’re really stuck with and can't get over, scroll down to the bottom, where I address disputes, and scroll back up. If it's not addressed, shoot me an email and I'll think about it.</p> <p class="bottom">Let’s start with the concept. Put yourself in the crowner’s shoes. You see a man who claims to be a king, and is facing the death sentence for it. You have several paths in front of you.</p> <p class="bottom">Scenario 1: You don't acknowledge that Jesus is King. If you were tasked with punishing a man who saw Himself as a king but was facing the death penalty for it, the proper reaction is pity. You pity a man who is deluded to the point of a death sentence.</p> <p class="bottom">Scenario 2: You acknowledge that He is King, and bow down before Him. Perhaps this is how we should see the women of Jerusalem.</p> <p class="bottom">Scenario 3: You acknowledge He is King, but you look away and squirm and avoid any interaction. Maybe you are afraid of the push back you may see by your associating with Him. Perhaps these are some of the people passing by. Perhaps this is Nicodemus or Joseph of Arimathea.</p> <p class="bottom">Scenario 4: You acknowledge He is King (or at least claims to be), and reject his Kingship. As an acknowledgement of his Kingship, you place a crown on his head. But it's a crown of thorns that you push in to torture him. Completely unnecessary, and propagated only by your will. Then you spit on him, mock him, and bow down before him. A man that you know is your king and your master. What a cruel way to act. This is what Jesus endures for us.</p> <p class="bottom">I’m not done yet. Now let's look at this from Jesus’ point of view.</p> <p class="bottom">With the scourging at the pillar, it's easier to forgive. Put yourself in Jesus’ shoes. You may not be happy about the situation, but  you can see from their point of view. One man is just trying to prevent a bloody rebellion. You even explicitly allow it, telling him your understanding as he looks to you for help. Another is a soldier just trying to do his job and follow orders, and not get fired for letting that rebellion get out of hand. From his point of view, if he scourges you well, you may not have to die.</p> <p class="bottom">On the other hand, the Crowning of Thorns is more a personal decision. It takes several levels of depravity. Let's continue from Jesus’ point of view. You know the crowner and his thoughts. It's 100% from his own free will and desire to punish and mock you. If we take scenario 4 from above, you know that he acknowledges you as King, yet strikes you and mocks you anyways. How tempting would it be to show a little bit of your power to remind him of who you are? But it's not just that. You are enduring all this for his sake. You are going through all this to forgive him of his sins, as he mocks you for it. And the entire time, you hold him in existence. You hold him in existence so that he can mock you as you die for his sake. As you die to forgive him of this moment.</p> <p class="bottom">Okay let's get back into our own heads now, that's enough imagining for today. But let me raise one more point. Are we not that guy in scenario 4? Do we not believe and profess and Jesus Christ is our king? Do we not echo St. Thomas’ words “My Lord and my God” every time we go to Mass? Yet do we not mock his Kingship by rejecting Him as Lord of our lives? We instead replace Him with another king - perhaps it's ourselves or pleasure or money. We know that we cannot serve both God and mammon. We bow down to Christ and proclaim Him King with our words, as we turn around and proclaim ourselves king with our actions. And do we not do this all of our own free will, with nobody forcing us to do so?</p> <p class="bottom">Perhaps I can try harder to be the women in Jerusalem.</p><p class="bottom">Dispute 1</p> <p class="bottom">You could argue that the crowner is really in scenario 1, but is just a crude and terrible person. Fine, I guess people like that exist. Read on then, and see note 3 when you get pointed to it.</p> <p class="bottom">Dispute 2</p> <p class="bottom">Sure, not a great excuse, the Nazis tried that one. But let’s be honest. There is some limited culpability. Who takes the primary blame? The soldier? Pilate? Me? It’s tough to place the blame squarely on a single person.</p> <p class="bottom">Dispute 3</p> <p class="bottom">Sure you may say that you really believe he is King, while the soldier doesn't. I argue that so does the soldier. But even if you reject the soldier’s belief, doesn’t that just make you worse?</p>

							<h3>What are you worth?</h3>
							When someone asks you who you are, the answer could be anything. A career - engineer, scientist, artist, writer, NEET, etc. Or some defining features - my laziness, my anger issues, my addictions. Or maybe it's something else entirely - my hairdo, or my signature water bottle, or the weird way I walk. </p> <p class="bottom"> Topic change - bet you didn't see that coming. As we all know, Christ died for our sins. And that He came and died specifically for your sins. Not just a generic "He died for everybody's sins and stuff," but He died specifically for your sins. For many others as well, but for you specifically. </p> <p class="bottom"> A thought came into my mind while thinking about this the other day. Does this not mean that the Lord thought of you as he carried His cross up Cavalry? As He was crucified and as he hung on the cross? In that moment, He thought of you and said "This is who I am doing this for. This is who I am suffering and dying for. I came into the world for this purpose." I know, that might be a lot of people to think about, but it's God doing the thinking here. I'm sure He could do it. </p> <p class="bottom"> No offense, but what makes you worth it? Really, don't take that offensively because as Jesus can tell you, you were worth it. You are worth it. This is sounding like some emotional pep talk - say that in front of the mirror 3 times every morning. Just kidding, let's get back on topic. The reality is that He did die for you. </p> <p class="bottom"> In my case, this was really hard to conceive of. Did Jesus die for me, who struggles with getting out of bed, going to a job I don't like? Who somehow always ends up sinning (am I not trying hard enough?)? Who writes some stupid posts that nobody reads? </p> <p class="bottom"> No. He died for a different side of me. And I bet you that if you try to look at yourself from God's point of view, you'll see a different you than that hipster scientist with anger management issues. And I'll wager that that's a better you. A more relevant you. The only you that matters. </p> <p class="bottom"> So maybe take some time to imagine that this Good Friday as you meditate on His 7 last words. Let's try to see ourselves the way God sees us. Maybe then we can get some perspective on how to live our lives and how to better glorify God. </p>
