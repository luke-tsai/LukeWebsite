								<img src="images/Affera-Cage.png" align="left" loading="lazy" style="margin:.5rem 1rem 1rem 0;"/>
								<p>Our primary device is a novel expandable ablation catheter used for treating heart rhythm disorders. The 9mm sphere collapses through a 8F insertion site on the patient’s thigh. The device is capable of global location tracking and capturing local electrocardiograms, allowing physicians to create a map of the heart’s condition before and after treatment. In our initial 3 months of first-in-human trials, our device has had remarkable success (98.7% of procedures successful, distributed across 71 patients, with no serious adverse events. Average procedure duration was shortened by an order of magnitude when compared to conventional devices). As of December 2019, we have successfully treated over 130 patients.</p>
								<p>As a early team member at Affera, Inc., my role evolved significantly over time as our system has evolved.  I have had significant involvement in the following mechanical components of our device:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The <b>irrigation nozzle</b> in an ablation catheter is responsible for keeping blood flowing and preventing the formation of clot. The component has a high risk, with failures potentially resulting in stroke, fistulas, and death. I was responsible for the design, testing, and verification of the component.</li>
									<li>The <b>spherical cage on our</b> device is the novel component that allows our device to effectively deliver energy to the cardiac tissue. I was responsible for characterizing various iterations of the design and identifying areas of risk that this novel approach brings, but not for the design itself. These characterizations and risk analyses were integral to iterating the design.</li>
									<li>The <b>valve crossing tool</b> is the component that allows us to get our expandable electrode through a small access port in the patient’s thigh. I was responsible for the design, testing, and verification of the assembly.</li>
									<li>The <b>tubing set</b> is an accessory to our device, and provides a reliable feed of saline on demand, while interfacing with a pump. I was responsible for this accessory, including defining hazards and specifications, design, testing, verification, and scaling for production. Risks relating to this component failure can include clots, stroke, and death.</li>
									<li>There is also an accessory device, of which I am responsible for the entire lifecycle of (including project definition, design and development, and verification).</li>
								</ul>

								<img src="images/Affera-Ablation.png" loading="lazy" style="margin:.5rem 1rem 1rem 0;"/>
								<p>I was also responsible for the following non-mechanical portions of our device:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The design and verification of our <b>packaging</b>, including the sterile barrier, labeling, and boxing. While not a glamourous role, reliably keeping a thin packaging film intact throughout various sterilization, vibration, temperature, and humidity cycles is very challenging, and is an area that gets significant scrutiny by the FDA.</li>
									<li>Our RF electrode is a significant departure from the rest of the market, so the <b>energy delivery profile</b> of our device needed characterization tuning from the ground up. This is an extremely sensitive area, where the wrong setting will often result in ineffective procedure, steam pops, or death for the patient. I was responsible for testing and optimizing the power delivery scheme to reliably, safely, and quickly create lesions of a targeted size.</li>
									<li>A significant portion of the <b>design verification</b> of our device, from defining risks and specifications, including writing and validating test protocols and methods, and up through training and overseeing the execution and reporting.</li>

								<p>As a Design Engineer Intern in product development at Motorola, I worked on the following:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>I was responsible for designing the PCB shields for a Motorola smartphone, interfacing with the electrical team on PCB component placement. This was followed by working with various suppliers for manufacturability and cost reduction.</li>
									<li>I conducted ALT (Accelerated Life Testing) on many prototype models to collect and analyze data to complement simulation data to inform design changes for future prototypes.</li>
									<li>I tested display/lens shattering and cracking on a large sample of devices. By observing shatter characteristics as a function of various dimensions in the glass cutouts, I formulated an empirical model that can be used to predict the lens shattering feasibility for devices in ongoing development.</li>
								</ul>

								<p>I was an active member in developing Andy 3.0, our protoflight rover considered to be our first space-ready robot.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Rover-Photo.png" loading="lazy"/></span>
								<p>I additionally served as the leader of six engineers on the camera systems team. The designed camera head was been tested for navigation and data collection. Further optimizations will be focused in reduction of camera-head mass while maintaining the current rigidity.</p>
								<p>In leading the team, I gained many valuable experiences beyond mechanical design. My position required frequent interfacing with other functional teams. I helped me to gain a global perspective of the project and to understand the necessary compromises in balancing our own deliverables against constraints from other teams. This leadership position also allowed me to appreciate the contributions of others and understand the importance of motivating each member.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Rover-Camera.png" loading="lazy"/></span>
								<p>Key specifications include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Simple manufacturing for rigidity and cost</li>
									<li>Simple mechanism to minimize failure points</li>
									<li>360˚ hazard detection</li>
									<li>Easy navigation (necessitated design and manufacture of viewing structure for natural, intuitive usage)</li>
									<li>HD view into the depths of Lacus Mortis (lunar pit with lava tubes)</li>
									<li>Panoramic imaging ability with .3 milliradians/pixel resolution, centered on the horizon</li>
									<li>Natural frequency above 75 Hz, and different from the mast and chassis natural frequencies</li>
									<li>Fisheye lens in line with the solar panel to minimize obstruction</li>
									<li>Structure with negligible camera occlusion</li>
									<li>Various visual design requirements to fit with the rover design language</li>
									<li>Operation in lunar conditions</li>

								<p> This robot was designed with a vision to create a simple robotic system that is low cost and robust as a learning platform for robotics education.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Mantis-CAD.jpg" loading="lazy"/></span>
								<p>Like a praying mantis, this robot has 6 legs. With a goal to keep the cost under $25,000 in its final form, we experienced many constraints in our designs of the robot. With this design, the robot could stand on the 4  rear legs while using the 2 front legs for manipulation, then bend forwards to use all 6 legs for locomotion. This would distribute the strain on each of the servos relatively evenly.</p>
								<p>I optimized for speed and range of movement, while minimizing stress on the servos. Objectives include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Complete redesign of limbs and body.</li>
									<li>Machining and assembly of robot.</li>
									<li>Created mathematical model using Denavit-Hartenberg parameters.</li>
									<li>Created new visual models for robot emulation and debugging .</li>
									<li>Bugfixes and tuning for basic movements.</li>
								</ul>

								<p>The father-son club at Warwick Foundation is a team-building hobby club. In this club, a father and son team works together to build a quadcopter drone, through which they learn and work together.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Multicopter-Lesson.png" loading="lazy"/></span>
								<p>I helped run the club as an engineering instructor and mentor by giving lectures on basic applied physics (fundamentals about brushless motors and propeller design, etc.), keeping in mind the nontechnical audience. I provided individual tutoring throughout the building process, teaching children and parents how to solder and program. The lessons concluded with short talks on how to build character, e.g. friendship, self-discipline, hard-work.</p>
